#Stripe Tester

Currently, this sandboxy thing lets you play around with Stripe Checkout.

*** TODO:***
* Handle the response from the backend code. 200 should let the user know that 
their donation succeeded, not-200 should let the user know that their payment 
blew up somewhere.

*** TIL ***
"Receipts for payments created using your test API keys are not sent automatically."
